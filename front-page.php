            <h1>COVID-19</h1>
            <h2>We are open for emergency treatment</h2>
            <p>The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has become a greater impact on
                our society in the last few weeks. We have been monitoring all communications from the North Carolina
                Dental Board,
                American Dental Association (ADA), Center for Disease Control (CDC), and North Carolina Department of
                Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). The current recommendation published by the NC Dental Board is to
                postpone all elective or non-emergent dental treatment.</p>
            <p>Therefore, White Oak Family Dentistry has decided to postpone all routine and elective treatment until
                April 30th. As soon as it is safe, we will resume normal hours of operation and work diligently to get
                all of our patients seen as soon as possible.</p>
